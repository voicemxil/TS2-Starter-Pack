# Graphics Setup

Due to hard-coded "graphics rules" and "video cards" databases made at the time of development, TS2 cannot detect modern GPUs out of the box, resulting in errors, crashes, and graphical bugs.

For example: crashing or inability to launch the game (DX9 error), forced low graphics settings/resolution, incorrectly detected texture memory, “pink flashing/soup” and more…

The fixes covered in this section address this, letting the game properly utilize your GPU.
