# Final Setup 

The Starter Pack comes with Sims2RPC by Lazy Duchess as both its no-CD patch and launcher. 
Non-Starter-Pack users who own Mansion & Garden Stuff can install RPC via auto installer or by manually extracting to \Fun with Pets\SP9\TSBin, or alternatively use “George” (a.k.a. no-CD version of Sims2EP9.exe) with the 4GB patch tool.

Sims2RPC provides:
- Discord Rich Presence integration
- No-CD crack for the game 
- “Firstborn syndrome” fix
- Optional: 4GB patch, automatic cache clearing, graphics & camera improvements, and many more useful features.

To launch the game, use Sims2RPC.exe located in “The Sims 2 Starter Pack\Fun with Pets\SP9\TSBin.” You will see RPC’s terminal window pop up and start loading, then the game should launch. 
If you choose to create shortcuts in the Web or Standalone Installers, a shortcut to the game will be made on both the Desktop and the Start Menu so you can launch it easily.

{: .note }
> RPC NOTICE: The Sims2RPC launcher has a false trojan flag in certain antivirus suites due to the way it injects code into TS2. 
> If when installing or launching the game, you find out your Sims2RPC files are mysteriously missing/quarantined, temporarily disable your antivirus (including Windows Defender) and create an exception for your Sims 2 folder, then reinstall Sims2RPC from [here](https://lazyduchess.tumblr.com/post/631915230388158464/sims2rpc-mod-launcher-for-mansion-garden).

The first time you open Sims2RPC, be sure to run it as Administrator so it can set up properly. You should also run its settings app (Sims2RPCSettings.exe) and check for updates if it doesn’t do so automatically.

Configure your RPC Settings:
1. Set the window mode:
   - Borderless: A modern fullscreen mode using a borderless window. 
   - Windowed: Runs the game as a window on the desktop. The in-game resolution setting affects the size of the game window. This mode can be upscaled to borderless from a lower resolution using tools like Magpie, giving the effect of a bigger UI without losing too much clarity.
   - Fullscreen: This mode fills the screen, even if lowering the screen resolution. This mode may cause the DirectX 9.0c error or have issues with alt-tabbing, if so please try windowed/borderless.
1. Check “Apply 4GB Patch” if you have 8GB or more of total RAM. (To check how much RAM you have, open Task Manager and choose “Memory” under the “Performance” tab.)

The rest of the options on the main page depend largely on personal preference, so set them however you like. Enabling Discord Rich Presence will share your TS2 game status on Discord!

Do not start the game with “Sims2EP9.exe." If you need to bypass Sims2RPC, you can run the “Sims2EP9RPC.exe” instead, which is always cracked/patched.
