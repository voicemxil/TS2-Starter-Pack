# Downloading the Starter Pack:
## Web Installer
   - All-in-one, automated download & install process via the Internet.
   - Directly downloads the game files as well as dependencies & fixes you need to make the game work correctly from GitHub.

     [Download](https://github.com/voicemxil/ts2-starter-pack/releases/latest){: .btn .btn-green }

If you do not have an active working connection to the GitHub server on the device you're installing the game, you must instead download the Touchup/Standalone Installer, the offline installer script, which requires downloading the game files to the game folder separately before use. They are avaialable [here](https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/tag/v12).

# Installation:
- üêß Linux/Steam Deck users should follow these steps in conjunction with the Linux-specific setup steps.
1. Download your chosen installer from the "Assets" section of the latest release.

1. Run the installer .exe using an administrator user account.
   - When opening you may be prompted that "Windows protected your PC" due to the installer not having a paid signature. To proceed, click the "More details" link and then "Run Anyway."
   - If antivirus interferes further for some reason, try temporarily disabling it to launch the installer and/or make an exception for your game folder.
1. Follow the prompts in the installer to proceed, then select the location your "The Sims 2 Starter Pack" folder & choose desired components.
   - The default location of "The Sims 2 Starter Pack" folder in Program Files (x86) is recommended. 
   - ONLY on modern AMD graphics card generations such as RX 400 (Polaris) series and later, it's recommended to enable the DXVK component to resolve bugs such as an extremely long launch wait time and loading screen.
1. Following the game installation process, you must set up Graphics Rules Maker and Sims2RPCSettings to optimize the game correctly for your system. Once you reach Graphics Rules Maker, continue to Part 2: Graphics Setup to fix the game‚Äôs graphics configuration for your system.

{: .note }
If your Web Installer installation is incomplete due to a download error or missing packs, either run the installer again with a better Internet connection or download & extract the missing packs from [here](https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/v12). In situations without a stable connection to GitHub or continued download errors, it may be better to use the standalone download+[Standalone/Touchup Installer](/standalone) instead.
