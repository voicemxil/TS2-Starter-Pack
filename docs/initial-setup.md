# Initial Setup

## 1. Know the recommended specs for modern systems:
   - Since TS2 was made for 2004 hardware, just about any recent computer should be able to run it. However, performance will vary depending on your specs. We recommend:
     - 2 GHz CPU or higher, at least 4-8GB of RAM, and 20 GB free space (~15 GB is the bare minimum to install, but youâ€™ll need more space for your neighborhoods and any custom content)
     - GPU with DirectX 9 or Vulkan support
     - Windows 10 or 11, or Linux using Steam/Lutris/etc. 
     - [Original Requirements (for base game/older hardware)](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Sims_2#System_requirements)

## 2. Update graphics drivers (Windows):
   - Driver download links for each GPU manufacturer: [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support), or [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html).

{: .warning }
"Microsoft Basic Render Driver" and pre-installed drivers from Microsoft/Windows Update cause issues. Make sure to use the latest drivers for your GPU directly from the manufacturer.

## 3. Install an archive manager (Windows) ðŸ“š:
   - Youâ€™ll need this to extract various kinds of files for the game, especially if you want CC/mods! I recommend 7-Zip.
     
## 4. Disable OneDrive Documents syncing (Windows):
   - Having OneDrive backup the Documents can result in disk space errors, conflicts, save-file corruption, missing hoods, etc. as it tries to sync before and during gameplay. You donâ€™t have to get rid of OneDrive entirely, you can still use the main OneDrive folder - but at the very least the Documents folder itself should be local to your user folder/excluded to ensure the gameâ€™s folder does not get synced.
